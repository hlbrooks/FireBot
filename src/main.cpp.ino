/** @file main.cpp
 *    This file contains the program for our final ME507 project which uses
 *    FreeRTOS to do multitasking. There are five total tasks that do the following:
 *    (1) - task_Rotation_Base - rotates the turntable while a fire has not been
 *                               detected by the thermal camera.  The turntable is 
 *                               rotated with a high torque motor.
 *    (2) - task_Thermal_Sensor - continuously uses thermal camera to scan for temperatures
 *                                within the view of the lense when a fire is not being 
 *                                extinguished. If a temperature above 140 degrees Fahrenheit
 *                                is measured, an interrupt is generated which raises the 
 *                                value of a share from 0 to 1, thus allowing the other tasks
 *                                to take the appropriate actions.
 *    (3) - task_Extinguisher -   when a fire is detected, this task actuates a motor that is 
 *                                press-fit to a lead screw which clamps down the lever of a 
 *                                fire extinguisher that is mounted to the assembly.  When the 
 *                                lever has been fully compressed, a micro limit switch is pressed
 *                                which switches the direction of the motor.  The motor rotates 
 *                                the lead screw thus translating the motor until a second mircro
 *                                limit switch is pressed.  At this point, the motor stops rotating,
 *                                and the assembly is reset, thus ready to extinguish another fire.
 *                                The motor which rotates the turntable resumes rotation.
 *    (4) - MicroSwitch1      -   this is the first of two micro limit switches in the assembly. This switch
 *                                is pressed when the fire extinguisher is fully compressed. This
 *                                switch is designed to change the value of the shared state variable
 *                                to 2 for the FSM within task_Extinguish. This will switch the direction
 *                                of the motor's rotation, thus translating the motor back toward its reset position
 *    (5) - MicroSwitch2      -   this is the second of two micro limit switches in the assembly. This switch
 *                                is pressed when the motor has fully translated back to the position it began
 *                                before the fire was extinguished. This switch is designed to change the value
 *                                of the shared state variable to 3 for the FSM within task_Extinguish. This will
 *                                halt the motor's rotation once it is back to its reset position
