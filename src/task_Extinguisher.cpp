/** @file task_Extinguisher.cpp
 *  This task consists of an FSM which extinguishes a fire when one is detected.
 *  When a fire is detected, this task actuates a motor that is press-fit to a 
 *  lead screw which clamps down the lever of a fire extinguisher that is mounted
 *  to the assembly.  When the lever has been fully compressed, a micro limit 
 *  switch is pressed which switches the direction of the motor.  The motor rotates 
 *  the lead screw thus translating the motor until a second mircro limit switch 
 *  is pressed.  At this point, the motor stops rotating, and the assembly is reset,
 *  thus ready to extinguish another fire. The motor which rotates the turntable 
 *  resumes rotation.

/** @brief   This is the task function that actuates the fire extinguisher to extinguish the detected fire
 *  @details This task consists of an FSM which extinguishes a fire when one is detected. When a fire is 
 *           detected, this task actuates a motor that is press-fit to a lead screw which clamps down the
 *           lever of a fire extinguisher that is mounted to the assembly.  When the lever has been fully
 *           compressed, a micro limit switch is pressed which switches the direction of the motor.  The 
 *           motor rotates the lead screw thus translating the motor until a second mircro limit switch 
 *           is pressed.  At this point, the motor stops rotating, and the assembly is reset, thus ready to
 *           extinguish another fire. The motor which rotates the turntable resumes rotation.
 *  @param   p_params A pointer to function parameters which we don't use.
